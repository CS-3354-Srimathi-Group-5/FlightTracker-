1. Create Testing Section
• Research Testing Technologies and Methodologies
• Create an introduction paragraph(s) on Testing Plan
• Create Functional and Non-Functional Test Cases for the Requirements/use case (add name who created TC)
• Use the table format for Test Cases and associated Requirements to complete the Requirements
Traceability Matrix (RTM)


2. Create Implementation Section
• Research Development Strategies based on your chosen Design and Delivery methodology
a) Create an introduction paragraph(s) on research findings
b) Create section on how you will implement this solution (how will you code and unit test)
c) Talk about resources needed, skills, methods, configuration management tool, etc

• Design Class Diagram - should capture all the classes with their attributes, methods as well as the
relationship between them - if there are any association classes, those also need to be captured with their
attributes & methods (you can use draw.io or lucidchart or visio or something similar). - in .pdf form

o Compare them with UML classes and associations you did in phase2.
o implement & test them based on your test cases; it is ok if your code does not pass all test cases.
